    <h2 class="center">What are Slide blocks?</h2>
    <p style="padding: 30px;">Slide Blocks, also know as Grind Blocks are usually made out of UHMW, or facy long name for a type of
        strong plastic, the best ones are self lubricating too but it doesn't matter too much. It's a piece of plastic that goes in between
        your wheels and it lets you stall and slide your rollerskates on coping and railing and anything you want.
    </p>

    <h2 class="center">Why would you want them?</h2>
    <p style="padding: 30px;">It's true that there's a lot of the things mentioned above that you could do to one degree or other without 
        slide blocks, but they can make a lot of these motions smoother, easier, or just more enjoyable. They can be a bit of an investment, 
        which is why it's a good idea to check if the slide blocks you are getting will fit your next pair of skates (the reason this was made)
        but they can help you be more confident and care free in your skating, decide if you need them and rock on!
